 * Render a button for adding an image to the editor content. You must provide

 * instance, you might open a popup for the user to provide an image URL, or you
 * might trigger a file upload via file input dialog.
 *
 * Once the image URL is ready (after the user has filled it out or after an
 * upload has completed), you can typically use something like:
 *
 *   editor.chain().focus().setImage({ src: url }).run()
 *
 * See Tiptap's example here https://tiptap.dev/api/nodes/image.
